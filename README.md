The **Golubâ€“Kahan method** is one of the prominent and efficient algorithms for computing the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, introduced by **Gene Golub** and **William Kahan** in **1965**. This method is recognized as a significant advancement in the field of **numerical linear algebra** and, due to its unique features, is widely used in **computer science**, **engineering**, and **data analysis**. We finish the report by implementing aforementioned iterative methods using Sympy and Jupyter Notebook. 

if you only want to read the report, check out the PDF `main.pdf`. Notebook is both embedded in the report and available at `CODE.ipynb`. Make sure to install [numpy](https://numpy.org/) before running the code.

`$ pip install numpy`
